## Description

This wordle clone was made purely in Python and PyQt5, the main insperation was to practice PyQt5 more.

### What is Wordle?

Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software egineer Josh wardle and owned and published by the New York Times Company since 2022.
Every day, a five-letter word is chosen at random wich players aim to guess within six tries. After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all.

### Why PyQt5?

PyQt5 is a Python binding of the popular GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, Qt. It allows developers to create desktop applications that can run on different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. PyQt5 provides a wide range of features and widgets for building interactive and professional-looking applications.

In addition, PyQt5 includes a designer called "QT Designer" that enables developers to create beautiful GUIs that can be programmed to perform various tasks.

PyQt5 has a wide range of uses. It can be used to develop games, desktop applications, educational apps, and scientific computing and data visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are important for data science. The main purpose of the **Wordle Clone** was to practice PyQt5 and gain more familiarity with its capabilities.
